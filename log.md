# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: June 1, 2023 (Variables)

**Today's Progress**: Print, String manipulations, debugging, Input 
Function, Band name generator

**Thoughts**: Started day 01 with all the enthusiasm to learn new things in 
Python. Although it's very basic print statements, it's nice to brushup things.
Way to go 100DaysOfCode!!!

### Day 02: June 2, 2023 (Data types and String manipulation)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about data types and string manipulations. 
Round of float and how to format float using f-strings ({a:.2f}). The 
interesting thing is Python stores floating point as base 2 binary fractions.
So 0.1 is approximation of 1/10 in Python.
Here, 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3 is False !!!

**Thoughts**: Learnt a new thing about how Python stores floats as base 2 
(binary) fractions.
