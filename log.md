# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: June 1, 2023 (Variables)

**Today's Progress**: Print, String manipulations, debugging, Input 
Function, Band name generator

**Thoughts**: Started day 01 with all the enthusiasm to learn new things in 
Python. Although it's very basic print statements, it's nice to brushup things.
Way to go 100DaysOfCode!!!

### Day 02: June 2, 2023 (Data types and String manipulation)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about data types and string manipulations. 
Round of float and how to format float using f-strings ({a:.2f}). The 
interesting thing is Python stores floating point as base 2 binary fractions.
So 0.1 is approximation of 1/10 in Python.
Here, 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3 is False !!!

**Thoughts**: Learnt a new thing about how Python stores floats as base 2 
(binary) fractions.

### Day 03: June 3, 2023 (Control flow and logical operators)

**Today's Progress**: If/else, even/odd number test, nested if and elif, 
leap year is interesting, pizza bill, logical operators

**Thoughts**: old stuff of conditional statements!

### Day 04: June 4, 2023 (Randomization and Python Lists)

**Today's Progress**: Mersenne Twister is a general-purpose pseudorandom 
number generator (PRNG) developed in 1997. 

From a random seed, we multiply by itself and select the half of the result 
as the next seed. pseudo random gen repeats itself after a period. For a 2 
digit seed it can generate 100 samples, for 3 digit it can generate 1000 
samples and so on. So as processing of computers increases we need to 
increase seed size for not to repeat.

Index of list is an offset basically.

**Thoughts**: *Programming is Open Book Exam*. Rock, paper and scissors was 
interesting!

### Day 05: June 5, 2023 (Python Loops)

**Today's Progress**: For loops for avg and high score w/o sum(), len() or max(). Range keyword. Sum of even numbers. FizzBuzz challenge! Password generator

join() only accepts strings and outputs string. So it can't be applied on lists to join lists! 

**Thoughts**: Loops in Python are very helpful. Remember String concatenation!

### Day 06: June 6, 2023 (Functions, While loops)

**Today's Progress**: Reeborgs world: nice tutorial for Functions! 


**Thoughts**: Use For loops when you need to do something with the items in the loop. Careful with While loop!

### Day 07: June 7, 2023 (Hangman challenge)

**Today's Progress**: Created Hangman challenge using loops and conditional 
statements. Interesting one!

**Thoughts**: To clear terminal use os.system('clear')

### Day 08: June 8, 2023 (Functions with Input)

**Today's Progress**: Parameter is the name of the data and Argument is the 
actual data passed to a function. Positional and Keyword arguments. Prime 
number checker. caesar cipher encrypt and decrypt using functions!

**Thoughts**: Interesting work and going good!

### Day 09: June 9, 2023 (Dictionaries, Nesting and Secret Auction)

**Today's Progress**: dictionary and alterations with it. Bidding with 
looping thru dicts.

For loop of dictionary gives only 'keys'!!!

**Thoughts**: Pythontutor is interesting website where we can get live help 
and we can also help others! Interesting!!!!

**Link to work**: [day09](day09/main.py)

### Day 10: June 10, 2023 (Functions with outputs)

**Today's Progress**: Functions with output, days in month using leap year 
function. Building calculator!

**Thoughts**: Be careful with recursion!

**Link to work**: [day10](day10/main.py)

### Day 11: June 11, 2023 (Blackjack Capstone Project)

**Today's Progress**: Capstone project with all the things learnt in 10 days!
Loops, functions, conditional statements!

**Thoughts**: Interesting and fascinating project!

**Link to work**: [day11](day11/main.py)

### Day 12: June 12, 2023 (Scope and Number guessing)

**Today's Progress**: NameSpace: Local and Global scope!

There is no Block scope in Python! Variables created inside a function has 
a local scope, but variables created in if, for, while blocks doesn;t have 
block scope.

Modify a global variable by defining with 'global' keyword inside local 
scope of a function!

**Thoughts**: Number guess game was good!

### Day 13: June 13, 2023 (Debugging)

**Today's Progress**: Debug the code thinking that you're the interpreter.

**Thoughts**: 'Print' is your friend!

**Link to work**: [day13](day13/main.py)

### Day 14: June 14, 2023 (Higher Lower Game)

**Today's Progress**: Higher Lower game is interesting.

**Thoughts**: Need to improve: optimization of code!

**Link to work**: [day14](day14/main.py)

### Day 15: June 15, 2023 (Coffee Machine Problem)

**Today's Progress**: Coffee Machine problem is very interesting to solve. 
Used if-else, functions, loops, dictionaries very well!

Hold Ctrl + Alt for multiple line editing in Pycharm (Linux)

**Thoughts**: Consistency and persistence is the key!

**Link to work**: [day15](day15/main.py)

### Day 16: June 16, 2023 (OOP)

**Today's Progress**: Procedural programming is complex. 
Attributes are variables of a class, methods are functions of a class! 
(they're not free floating, so given a different name!).
A class is a blueprint/template for creating different object.
An object is an instance of a class!
PyPI - Python Package Index.

**Thoughts**: OOP is a saviour!

**Link to work**: [day16](day16/main.py)

### Day 17: June 17, 2023 (Benefit of OOP)

**Today's Progress**: PascalCase, snake_case, camelCase. Quiz game with OOP. 

**Thoughts**:
