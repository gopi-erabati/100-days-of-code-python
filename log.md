# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: June 1, 2023 (Variables)

**Today's Progress**: Print, String manipulations, debugging, Input 
Function, Band name generator

**Thoughts**: Started day 01 with all the enthusiasm to learn new things in 
Python. Although it's very basic print statements, it's nice to brushup things.
Way to go 100DaysOfCode!!!

### Day 02: June 2, 2023 (Data types and String manipulation)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about data types and string manipulations. 
Round of float and how to format float using f-strings ({a:.2f}). The 
interesting thing is Python stores floating point as base 2 binary fractions.
So 0.1 is approximation of 1/10 in Python.
Here, 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3 is False !!!

**Thoughts**: Learnt a new thing about how Python stores floats as base 2 
(binary) fractions.

### Day 03: June 3, 2023 (Control flow and logical operators)

**Today's Progress**: If/else, even/odd number test, nested if and elif, 
leap year is interesting, pizza bill, logical operators

**Thoughts**: old stuff of conditional statements!

### Day 04: June 4, 2023 (Randomization and Python Lists)

**Today's Progress**: Mersenne Twister is a general-purpose pseudorandom 
number generator (PRNG) developed in 1997. 

From a random see, we multiply by itself and select the half of the result 
as the next seed. pseudo random gen repeats itself after a period. For a 2 
digit seed it can generate 100 samples, for 3 digit it can generate 1000 
samples and so on. So as processing of computers increases we need to 
increase seed size for not to repeat.

Index of list is an offset basically.

**Thoughts**: *Programming is Open Book Exam*. Rock, paper and scissors was 
interesting!
